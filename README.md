# Impawnstor - Chess Player Impostor Bot

Welcome to the chess project repository. This project started as a collaborative effort between Cooper and Abe (founders) to explore and create an interesting application related to chess.
At this moment, the project is very loosely defined. Hopefully, we can add more information here when we're ready to start programming!


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for us to explore our shared interest in the game of chess, have something cool and interesting to show on our portfolios, and have some fun programming!


## Ideas for execution
- Train using neural network (or maybe using a chatbot foundation)
- Plays based on a real account from chess.com (maybe lichess in future), and every game trains the neural network (OpenAI gym???)
